# Phase 15 Cross-Language Convergence Pack

This fixture pack provides minimal, deterministic repositories for command-contract convergence
checks across Rust, Go, Python, and TypeScript runner contexts.

Coverage goals:

- `tests-for` runnable target behavior per language.
- `verify-plan` targeted command synthesis per language.
- `verify-plan` full-suite gate selection per language.
