# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/main.rs` contains the Rust entry point.
- `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` define dependencies and build metadata.
- `target/` holds build artifacts (generated by Cargo).
- `agents/PLANS.md` documents ExecPlan requirements for agent-driven work.

Add new modules under `src/` (for example, `src/utils.rs` or `src/utils/mod.rs`) and declare them from `main.rs` or a crate root module.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `cargo run` — builds and runs the binary locally.
- `cargo build` — compiles the crate without running it.
- `cargo test` — runs unit and integration tests (none yet by default).
- `cargo fmt` — formats code with `rustfmt`.
- `cargo clippy` — lints code for common issues (optional but encouraged).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

Use standard Rust 2024 edition conventions and keep code `rustfmt`-clean.

- Indentation: 4 spaces (Rust default).
- Modules, files, and functions: `snake_case`.
- Types and traits: `CamelCase`.
- Constants: `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
  Keep functions small and prefer explicit error handling over `unwrap()` in non-test code.

## Testing Guidelines

There are currently no tests. When adding tests:

- Unit tests: place in the same module with `#[cfg(test)]`.
- Integration tests: add files under `tests/`.
- Name test functions in `snake_case`, describing behavior.
  Run `cargo test` before submitting changes.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

This repository has no commit history yet, so no formal convention exists. Recommended:

- Use Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) or short imperative subjects.
- Keep commits focused and describe the “why” in the body if needed.
- PRs should include: summary, test command run (or “not run”), and any relevant screenshots/logs.

## Agent-Specific Notes

If you create or modify ExecPlans, follow the requirements in `agents/PLANS.md`.

# ExecPlans

When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in `agents/PLANS.md`) from design to implementation.
