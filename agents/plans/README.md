# ExecPlan Inventory Policy

## Legacy Scope Labeling

The following ExecPlans are **legacy pre-Tiger adoption artifacts**:

- `agents/plans/repo-scout-phase1-execplan.md`
- `agents/plans/repo-scout-phase2-execplan.md`
- `agents/plans/repo-scout-phase3-execplan.md`
- `agents/plans/repo-scout-phase4-execplan.md`
- `agents/plans/repo-scout-phase5-execplan.md`
- `agents/plans/repo-scout-phase6-execplan.md`
- `agents/plans/repo-scout-phase7-execplan.md`
- `agents/plans/repo-scout-phase8-execplan.md`

These files remain as historical delivery records. They are not retroactively required to include the
full Contract System v2 section set.

## Current Conformance Boundary

`agents/plans/repo-scout-phase9-execplan.md` and all future ExecPlans are in the Tiger-era
conformance scope and must include:

- `## Contract Inputs`
- `## AGENTS.md Constraints`
- `## Risk Tier and Required Controls`

Future plans should also map task/test/evidence intent to `templates/` and run contract validators
before implementation.

## Phase 9 Superseded Status

`agents/plans/repo-scout-phase9-execplan.md` is retained as a **historical planning artifact**.
Its milestone intent was closed through later implemented phases (13-15) and subsequent
documentation/validation closure (16+). It remains in Tiger-era conformance scope for structure, but
should not be treated as an active open implementation phase.
