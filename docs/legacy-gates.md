# Legacy Gates and Policies

This section keeps historical phase-based governance and threshold artifacts that are still used by repository scripts and CI checks.

These docs are retained for operational compatibility and auditability.

Current operational references include:

- performance baselines and thresholds
- phase-specific release checklist and known-issues budget
- phase18 maintenance backlog and cadence policy
- contract artifact policy

For day-to-day usage, start with the primary docs sections and treat this section as compatibility/history context.
